You've started to see **assertions** in your coursework that look something like this:

```js
expect(sum(10,32)).toBe(42);
```

a) Describe, in your own words, what the above assertion checks.

its checking if 10 + 32 is 42 and if its not 42 the tet will fail

b) Write an **assertion** that checks that a function `isMultipleOfTen` returns `true` when called with the input `80`
You can check out the [Jest documentation here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#matchers) to help you with this task.

```js
expect(isMultipleOfTen(80)).toBe(true);
```
